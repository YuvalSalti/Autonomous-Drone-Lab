# Part X – [Title of This Part]

## Overview

In this part, we will explore the essential software tools required for the entire project.<br>
We will install the necessary development environments, configure them, and run an initial test to verify that the Teensy 4.0 board is working correctly and ready for further development.

---

## Objectives

- [ ] Install the required software tools (Arduino IDE, Teensyduino)
- [ ] Set up the Teensy 4.0 development environment
- [ ] Verify communication between the computer and the Teensy board
- [ ] Upload a basic test program (e.g., blinking LED) to the Teensy.
