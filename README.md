# Autonomous Drone Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Drone-Lab project ‚Äî an autonomous drone development journey inspired by the designs of Carbon Aeronautics.

This project begins with the design, assembly, and flight testing of a quadcopter based on Carbon Aeronautics‚Äô drone model. The goal of this phase is to build a stable flight platform and implement core flight control firmware using the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller.

At this stage, the drone uses real-time sensor feedback from an onboard gyroscope and barometer to control and stabilize flight. The system interprets receiver inputs using the PulsePosition library and applies PID control loops for Roll, Pitch, and Yaw stabilization. Motor control is handled through PWM signals.

While GPS navigation and obstacle avoidance are planned for future phases, this repository currently focuses on:
-	Mechanical assembly & wiring
-	Sensor calibration and real-time data processing
-	PID control loop implementation for flight stabilization
-	Teensy 4.0-based firmware development
-	Basic motor test routines and receiver input integration

Future extensions will explore full autonomy, GPS navigation, and obstacle avoidance.
> üöß This repository is a work in progress ‚Äî new parts and updates will be added continuously as the project develops.

## Purpose

To learn the fundamentals of drone design and control, including hardware integration, sensor fusion using a Kalman filter, and PID-based flight stabilization using a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller.
